### Hi there 👋

My name is Fabricio Demattê, ex data science student that should be a software engineer sooner but only realised his passion for development at university.
Every project idea that pops in my head are naturally oriented to help and be useful to others, that's why I'm so into open source today. 

#### 👷‍♂️ Who are you now?

- At work I'm a fullstack web engineer

#### 🔭 What do you do on a daily basis?

- Typescript, ReactJS at work by the morning
- C++ and algorithm studies by the afternoon
- Rust and open source by the evening
- Prototyping projects that i won't ever finish by the weekends

#### 🔥 What excites you the most lately? 
- Blockchain,  Web 3.0
- Linux
- Rust

#### ⚡ Fun facts? 
- Linux user since 11 y.o. Back then i could barely compile a package but i used to spent my whole day distro hopping and customizing my desktop
- I can't finish a project.
